This is an app for keeping track of habits, primarily by allowing users to keep track of streaks. It has been my experience, and the experience of Jerry Seinfeld, that if you have a visual reminder of how many days in a row you've done something, you'll be less inclined to not do that thing. For example, I have a very long streak of commits to my Github account. The very thought of breaking that streak is disturbing to me at this point.
