# Skill Streak
#### Build your skills, one day at a time
---

This web app is designed to keep track of each user's progress by building streaks of days in which the skill in question is practiced. In my own experience, I've found that having a streak is a powerful motivational tool - once you've built up a certain number of days, you really don't want to stop.

Additionally, I plan to add a social component that connects to Facebook, Twitter, etc. so that peer pressure can be used as an addtional motivation.
